Consumer group rebalancing is triggered when partitions need to be reassigned among consumers in the consumer group: A new consumer joins the group; an existing consumer leaves the group; an existing consumer changes subscription; or partitions are added to one of the subscribed topics.

Rebalancing is orchestrated by the group coordinator and it involves communication with all consumers in the group. 


Consumer get batch of records from Kafka.
Case: auto commit
	once all the records has processed and consumer send request to poll again, then only offset is commited.
	
	
The maximum delay allowed between poll method calls is defined by the max.poll.interval.ms config, which is five minutes by default. If a consumer fails to call the poll method within that interval, it is considered dead, and group rebalancing is triggered.
